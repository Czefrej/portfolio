## Allegro Trade Analysis Tool

After the shutdown of the Allegro WebAPI, sellers were cut off from valuable market data. In response, I developed a web scraping tool to collect this data on my own. Although the data gathering method was not robust, the tool was able to crawl nearly 10,000,000 pages in under an hour, utilizing Proxies and AWS Lambda. However, the project ultimately failed due to challenges in managing and covering the costs associated with maintaining such a large database.

The template was bought on wrapbootstrap.com
